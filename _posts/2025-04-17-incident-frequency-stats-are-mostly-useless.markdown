Security incident frequency stats are (mostly) useless. Unless we agree on - or know - what a security incident actually is.
<!--more-->

Every few months, a new report drops with dramatic headlines:
- “Cyber incidents up 300%!”
- “Companies face an average of 5 incidents per week!”

But here’s the catch: what counts as an incident?
- A phishing email caught by a spam filter?
- A failed login attempt?
- Malware blocked at the endpoint?
- A confirmed data breach?

Without a *shared definition* - or at least a clear one in context - incident frequency becomes a useless metric. (Unless your goal is to grab attention. In that case, move along.)

Until we standardize - or, more realistically, define clearly within a specific report - what we're measuring, incident counts are just noise dressed up as signal.

Obviously, I don’t have the catch-all solution.

A first step might be to count only incidents that caused actual damage to the target.
But even that gets messy.

Are we talking only *primary losses* (in the FAIR sense: lost revenue, replacement costs, remediation, etc.)?
Or do we include *secondary losses* (PR fallout, legal costs, regulatory penalties, etc.)?

And even if we settle that, let’s not forget - we’re talking frequency.

High-volume, low-impact incidents dilute the stat - and reduce its usefulness.

Which brings me to my two main points:
- *Be wary when using a stat.* If you're justifying a security initiative and your stat includes phishing emails caught by a spam filter… expect (and deserve) pushback - unless you're pitching anti-spam solutions.
- *Show your work when publishing a stat.* If your number isn't just marketing fluff and you want people to use it - give us the context. Let us engage with your data in good faith.

(And next time, maybe I’ll rant about [why incidents that don’t cause damage are still important]({% post_url 2025-04-24-near-misses-are-worth-talking-about %}) - and how underdeveloped near-miss reporting is.)
